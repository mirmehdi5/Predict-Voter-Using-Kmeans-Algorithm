# Predict-Voter-Using-Kmeans-Algorithm

This projects trains and predicts the data as to which political party the user would vote for in future.

Please read the readme file in each project to understand their implementation.

# Tip 

Start with vote-project.

# Note

For the purpose of demonstration of MDB and EJB, a message is passed to the MDB which in-turn invokes the EJB to call an external JAR file which runs the K-Means algorithm. This JAR file can be called directly in the Managed Bean in the "vote-project".
